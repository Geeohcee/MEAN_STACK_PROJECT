**What is Tech Stack** :A tech stacks comprises of the many components which work together to produce an application which serves the needs of users and businesses. This comprises of **Front-end framework, Back-end framework and Database technologies**
1. **Front-end framework** does most of the “heavy lifting” of building a complex website or mobile app, so the developers and designers can focus on providing the specific features and fixes needed by the users and the business. **E.g React.js** 
2. **Back-end framework** does most of the “heavy lifting” of communication between the website or mobile app and the database and business logic. **E.g Express.js** 
3. **Database technologies** store and organize data, as well as provide features for searching, filtering, and reporting data. **E.g MongoDb** 


**WHAT IS A MERN STACK**: MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: **MongoDB, Express.JS, React.JS and Node.JS** It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier

**MEAN STACK COMPONENT**

**MongoDB** – A “NoSQL” database and non-relational document-orientated database used for storing data for a back-end JavaScript application. MongoDB stores data in flexible documents using a query language based on JavaScript Object Notation(JSON). The size, number and content of document fields vary, so the data structure can be altered later on If your application has users, MongoDB is an example of a database where your user information will be kept.
