# MEAN_STACK_PROJECT

**What is Tech Stack** :A Tech stack comprises of the many components which work together to produce an application which serves the needs of users and businesses. This comprises of **Front-end framework, Back-end framework and Database technologies**
1. **Front-end framework** does most of the “heavy lifting” of building a complex website or mobile app, so the developers and designers can focus on providing the specific features and fixes needed by the users and the business. **E.g React.js** 
2. **Back-end framework** does most of the “heavy lifting” of communication between the website or mobile app and the database and business logic. **E.g Express.js** 
3. **Database technologies** store and organize data, as well as provide features for searching, filtering, and reporting data. **E.g MongoDb** 


**WHAT IS A MERN STACK**: MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: **MongoDB, Express.JS, React.JS and Node.JS** It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier

**MEAN STACK CORE COMPONENT**

**MongoDB** – A “NoSQL” database and non-relational document-orientated database used for storing data for a back-end JavaScript application. MongoDB stores data in flexible documents using a query language based on JavaScript Object Notation(JSON). The size, number and content of document fields vary, so the data structure can be altered later on If your application has users, MongoDB is an example of a database where your user information will be kept.

**Express.JS** - A light backend framework for serving content to the web. If your backend application needs to send information across the Internet, Express provides tools for accomplishing that.Express’s framework was designed to enable simple, easy construction of APIs and efficient web applications. It is loaded with plugin features and is renowned for its speed. Its minimalistic structure makes it simple for developers to pick up and start using right away.

**React.js** - Is a front-end Javascript framework /library . It is is a tool to build UI components – everything that concerns putting together visual elements, binding data to those elements, and specifying the logic governing it. It was developed by facebook to builds it component . It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components . Take for example on facebook ,if you like a post or add a comment, the entire page must be reloaded to reflect this change. However, developers can bypass this by enabling partial reload. That is, in the case of liking a post, the ‘like’ icon changes color to reflect the change, while the rest of the page remains the same. So it lets developers use a full-featured programming language to design conditional or repetitive DOM elements rather than relying on templates that automatically create repetitive DOM (Document Object Model) or HTML elements.  It is  recommend Express. js is used as a backend service
