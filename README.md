# MEAN_STACK_PROJECT

**What is Tech Stack** :A Tech stack comprises of the many components which work together to produce an application which serves the needs of users and businesses. This comprises of **Front-end framework, Back-end framework and Database technologies**
1. **Front-end framework** does most of the “heavy lifting” of building a complex website or mobile app, so the developers and designers can focus on providing the specific features and fixes needed by the users and the business. **E.g React.js** 
2. **Back-end framework** does most of the “heavy lifting” of communication between the website or mobile app and the database and business logic. **E.g Express.js** 
3. **Database technologies** store and organize data, as well as provide features for searching, filtering, and reporting data. **E.g MongoDb** 


**WHAT IS A MERN STACK**: MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: **MongoDB, Express.JS, React.JS and Node.JS** It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier

**MEAN STACK CORE COMPONENT**

**MongoDB** – A “NoSQL” database and non-relational document-orientated database used for storing data for a back-end JavaScript application. MongoDB stores data in flexible documents using a query language based on JavaScript Object Notation(JSON). The size, number and content of document fields vary, so the data structure can be altered later on If your application has users, MongoDB is an example of a database where your user information will be kept.

**Express.JS** - A light backend framework for serving content to the web. If your backend application needs to send information across the Internet, Express provides tools for accomplishing that.Express’s framework was designed to enable simple, easy construction of APIs and efficient web applications. It is loaded with plugin features and is renowned for its speed. Its minimalistic structure makes it simple for developers to pick up and start using right away.

**React.Js** - Is a front-end /client-side Javascript framework.It is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. So it lets developers use a full-featured programming language to design conditional or repetitive DOM elements rather than relying on templates that automatically create repetitive DOM (Document Object Model) or HTML elements.  It is  recommend Express. js is used as a backend service

**Node.Js** - NodeJS is a cross-platform and opensource Javascript runtime environment that allows the javascript to be run on the server-side. Nodejs allows Javascript code to run outside the browser. Nodejs comes with a lot of modules and mostly used in web development.Node.JS makes use of Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine and is intended to allow developers to build scalable network applications and execute JavaScript code outside of browsers. Node.js works by using its own module system that is based on CommonJS, meaning it does not need an enclosing HTML page to put together more than one JavaScript file
